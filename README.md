# PulsePilot AI

PulsePilot AI is an AI-driven product feedback and engineering copilot for SaaS
teams. It is designed to analyze feedback, detect related reports, prioritize
issues, and keep critical actions behind human approval.

## Current status

Sprint 1 is in progress. The .NET 10 Clean Architecture foundation and the core
domain model are ready. The domain currently covers users, workspaces,
workspace membership, feedback lifecycle rules, and processing state
transitions.

## Solution structure

- `PulsePilot.Domain`: domain entities and business rules
- `PulsePilot.Application`: use cases and application abstractions
- `PulsePilot.Infrastructure`: persistence and external service adapters
- `PulsePilot.Api`: ASP.NET Core HTTP API
- `PulsePilot.UnitTests`: domain and application tests
- `PulsePilot.IntegrationTests`: API and infrastructure tests

## Build

Install the .NET 10 SDK, then run:

```powershell
dotnet restore PulsePilot.sln
dotnet build PulsePilot.sln --configuration Release --no-restore
dotnet test PulsePilot.sln --configuration Release --no-build
```

The README will be expanded with architecture, Docker, API, AI evaluation, and
deployment documentation as the project progresses.
